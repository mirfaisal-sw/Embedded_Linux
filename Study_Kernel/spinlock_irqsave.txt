spin_lock_irqsave():- 
---------------------------
spin_lock_irqsave is basically used to save the interrupt state before taking the spin lock, this is
because spin lock disables the interrupt, when the lock is taken in interrupt context, and re-enables
it when while unlocking. The interrupt state is saved so that it should reinstate the interrupts again.

Example:

	1. Lets say interrupt x was disabled before spin lock was acquired
	2. spin_lock_irq will disable the interrupt x and take the the lock
	3. spin_unlock_irq will enable the interrupt x.

So in the 3rd step above after releasing the lock we will have interrupt x enabled which was earlier disabled before the lock was acquired.

So only when we are sure that interrupts are not disabled only then we should use spin_lock_irq otherwise we should always use spin_lock_irqsave.
