	Steps for Cherry Pick: -
	==========================

	Suppose a commit is there in Gerrit and we want to cherry pick in our local repo, then we do as below.

	I. Open the commit in Gerrit1.harman.com and then on top right side clock on three dots(...), then click
	   on "Download patch", copy the link corresponding to "Cherry pick". Also in Gerrit there is a tab called
	   "Download", where source file name is represented, from here also we can copy the link for "Cherry pick".

	II. Open local repo in PC and on terminal paste the link copied from Step I and then press ENTER.

	III. Now verify the commit in local repo, by running below command.
		#git log


	Note: - Cherry Pick use case: Suppose any repo is pushed and we want to push some patch to address review comment.
	=====   But unfortunately my local repo is erased, then in this case we can sync code again, then we can do cherry
                pick, then we can push patch on the same pushed gerrit.


        Cherry pick from one branch to another using command: -
	===========================================
	I. Suppose commit ID - 45F67E3294 (for example) of any branch, we want to cherry pick to current branch, then go to
	current branch and run below command.
	# git cherrypick 45F67E3294
