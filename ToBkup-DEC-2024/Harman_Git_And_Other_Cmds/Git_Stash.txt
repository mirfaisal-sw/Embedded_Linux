Git squash: -
===============
git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes we've made to our working 
copy so we can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them 
later on.

Stashing is handy if we are mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to
commit.

Stash for future use: - 
-------------------------
	# git stash

Reapplying stashed changes: - 
------------------------------
	# git stash pop
