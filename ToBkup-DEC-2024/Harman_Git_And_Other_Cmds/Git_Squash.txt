Git squash: -
===============
	"squash" in Git means to combine multiple commits into one.

Suppose I have pushed multiple commits, let us say 4 commits and we want to squash
them into single one.
Ex - 	Commit -1 with id: aaaa
	Commit -2 with id: bbbb
	Commit -3 with id: cccc
	Commit -4 with id: dddd

Commit 1 is the latest commit and I want to merge commits 2, 3 and 4 to Commit -1, then 
we will use below command.

# git rebase -i
O/p - 	pick aaaa
	pick bbbb
	pick cccc
	pick dddd

Then we will modify above as below: -
	pick aaaa
	s bbbb
	s cccc
	s dddd

Now, all commits will merged to commit - 1. Now we can edit commit message.

We can run "git commit --amend" and then we can push.
