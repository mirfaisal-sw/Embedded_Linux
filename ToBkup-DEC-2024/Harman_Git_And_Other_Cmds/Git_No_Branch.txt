To find Remote branch in case of "no branch" in local: -
========================================================

Suppose we synced Yocto and we entered into a directory, where there is a repository. If we suppose run the
command "git branch", then we get as below.

$ git branch
O/p - 
* (no branch)

Our requirement is to push my changes to remote repo, but not aware with the branch.So in this case to know remote
branch, run below command.

$ git branch -av
O/p - 
* (no branch)                            a7d17ad643ca Port V920 ES2 Changes
  remotes/m/platform-t-mainline          -> origin/platform-t-mig-v920-ES2
  remotes/origin/platform-t-mig-v920-ES2 a7d17ad643ca Port V920 ES2 Changes

Now in this output we will se commit ID at local branch matches with which remote/origin branch, the matching remote branch 
is the one to which we should push our changes.
