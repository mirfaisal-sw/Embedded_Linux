To check patch error use below command: -
==========================================
#cd <linux_src>
#./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f <file_name>


If we are not at root folder of linux kernel source tree, then 
we can use --notree flag.


=> Linux kernel documentation: -
https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/checkpatch.html

=> Use of --fix-inplace flag: -
If we use this flag with checkpatch.pl then input file is overwritten with fixes.
Note - DO NOT USE this flag unless we are absolutely sure and we have a backup in place.
