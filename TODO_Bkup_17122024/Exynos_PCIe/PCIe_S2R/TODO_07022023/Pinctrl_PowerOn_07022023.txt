1) When a device is probed, itsdefaultpinctrlstate isrequested automatically.

	sp0: ssp@80010000 {
		
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&mmc0_8bit_pins_a&mmc0_cd_cfg &mmc0_sck_cfg>;
	};

2) pinctrl-states "default" and "sleep": -

When your device is probed by the kernel, if we have those pinctrl lines in your dts then the kernel requests the pinctrl subsystem to configure the pins 
listed under brcm,pins as their respective functions defined under brcm,function. The pinctrl state named default is requested to be set by the kernel automatically.
We may define other states as

pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";

pinctrl-0 = <&spi1_default>;
pinctrl-1 = <&spi1_sleep>;

and for other states like sleep or idle you will have to explicitly call them when the driver changes state for power management by calling functions pinctrl_pm_select_sleep_state 
or pinctrl_pm_select_idle_state respectively. You can only call these functions if the respective pin states are defined in device tree else you might have to do the configuring 
manually calling the pinctrl apis.
