	On RC side
	-----------
	#PERST signal is generally asserted once the RC initialization (clocks init, phy init, controller init) is completed and is ready for link initialization.

	On EP side
	-----------
	Once the EP detects that the #PERST is asserted, it is an indication to EP that the RC provided power and clock are stable and EP side can start initialization
	on the device for PCIe linkup.
