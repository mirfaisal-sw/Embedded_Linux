	First I tried to understand what triggers an SError interrupt. It seems ARMv8 (and also ARMv7) has three types of
	interrupts. FIQ, IRQ and System Error Interrupts. According to the ARM manual System Error Interrupts are often thrown
	when there is something wrong with memory access. The cause can be found by reading out the ESR register which is also 
	printed as code when the SError interrupt happens:
