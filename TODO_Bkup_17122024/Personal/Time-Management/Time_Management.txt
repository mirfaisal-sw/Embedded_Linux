1. 
Track how you spend your time to identify your biggest time-wasters or “time-stealers” throughout the day. 
Look for opportunities to save or redistribute your time to align with your interests, goals, and values.

analyzing their time, prioritizing their tasks, and creating a schedule for their day or week.
