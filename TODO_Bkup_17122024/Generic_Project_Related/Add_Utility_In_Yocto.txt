Procedure to add package/utility in Yocto build:-
===================================================

	I. 	First we need to search any Yocto supplied layer is having recipe to build that
		utility.
		For example, suppose we want to build "Bootchart" binary.
	
		#cd <yocto-code-base>/sources
		#grep -ir bootchart*
		O/p - 
		...
		...
		...
		meta-openembedded/meta-oe/recipes-devtools/bootchart/bootchart_git.bb:HOMEPAGE =
			"http://meego.gitorious.org/meego-developer-tools/bootchart"
		meta-openembedded/meta-oe/recipes-devtools/bootchart/bootchart_git.bb:SRC_URI = 
			"git://gitorious.org/meego-developer-tools/bootchart.git;protocol=https \
		...
		...
		
		=> From above it is clear that in meta layer "meta-openembedded/meta-oe", there is a recipe file
		which is downloading "Bootchart" source file and will build.
	
	II. Now we have to search a variable "IMAGE_INSTALL" or "IMAGE_INSTALL_append" in
		a recipe file (extension .bb) in our board specific layer which generates image.
	
		I found it to be: -
		<yocto-code-base>/sources/meta-samsung-virt/meta-sys/recipes-core/images/sys-domain.bb
	
		$vim sys-domain.bb
		o/p - 
	
		{Edit variable "IMAGE_INSTALL_append" as below}
		..
		..
		IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " \
								bootchart \
								"
		..
		..
	
	III. Now buid as per the build procedure. This will populate our utility in our root file 
	     system.
		 
	IV. Verify whether binary is build as a part of our root file system.For this we have to look
		into manifest file in /tmp/deploy/images/<hardware name> folder.
		
		# cd tmp/deploy/images/idcevo-hv
		# cat sys-domain-idcevo-hv-20220628042156.rootfs.manifest | grep bootchart
		O/p - 
		bootchart aarch64 1.17
