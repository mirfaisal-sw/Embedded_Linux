Introduction: -
------------------
By using tmux tell, we can divide or spilt terminals in to various horizontal and vertical panes
as well as we can create new window. We can switch to spillted terminals and windows using tmux.

Install tmux: -
------------------
	#sudo apt install tmux

Usage: -
-------------
a) Start tmux shell: -
	#tmux 
	
b) To split terminal Horizontally: -
   	Press CTRL + B key, release it and then immediately press " (double quote).
	Note - to press double quote key one have to use SHIFT key as well.
	
c) To split terminal Vertically: -
	Press CTRL + B key, release it and then immediately press % (percent).	

d) To delete or close the child terminal: -
	Press CTRL + D key.
	
e) Suppose any splitted terminal we want to zoom, then do as below.
	Press CTRL + B, followed by key Z.
	To return back to original, do the same i.e. CTRL + B, followed by Z (zee) key.

f) If we keep on creating teminal splits, then it will become messy, so in this case we
   we can create new window.
   To create new window -> CTRL+B, c
   To come back to previous window -> CTRL+B, p
   
   To kill a window -> CTRL+B, &
   
   Renaming a window: -
   If we are working on multiple windows, then it is hard to remember on which window what work is 
   going on, for this we can give certain identifier or name to window. Fow this, do as below.
   
   Press CTRL+B and then press , (comma)
   Then we can rename window's name.
   
g) Detaching from tmux session: -
	Suppose we are working on tmux session having muyltiple splits, now we want to come to normal 
	shell, then in that case we can detach from tmux shell.
	For this we can press CTRL+B, d
	
	" d for detach"
	
h) Attaching to tmux sessions: -
	Suppose we have created one or more tmux sessions, by running tmux command (i.e. #tmux <-|) and 
	also we are detached from tmux sessions.
	Now, we can attach to a tmux session back. For this first we may need to know list of sessions to 
	which to attach. So, for this we will use command as below.
	#tmux list-sessions
	O/p - 
		0: 2 windows (created Sun Aug 14 15:12:45 2022) [205x51]
		1: 1 windows (created Sun Aug 14 15:17:38 2022) [205x51]
	
	Hence, for example there are two tmux sessions 0 and 1 currently running. 
	Now, to attach back to a tmux session, we can use below command.
	
	#tmux attach -t <session_id>
	Ex - #tmux attach -t 1
	
i) Rename a session: -
	We can rename a session to meaningful identifier. For this we have to attach to a session which is
	to be renamed. Then we use below key sequence to rename.
	
	CTRL+B, $
	Now, type meaningful name, for example - kernel_program
	
	So, if we are detached and want to attach, then instead of using session ID we can use session name.
	For example: -
	#tmux attach -t kernel_program
	
j) Create a new tmux session along with session name.
	#tmux new -s <my_session_name>
